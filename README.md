# Chess Board

This project will form the basis of a couple of Chess based ideas I have.

- A general intelligent chess board
- An engine to play against
  - Maybe that should be a seperate project and this one could have a plugin architecture
    for different engines
- Log my chess games interface / database (http://logmychessgames.com)
